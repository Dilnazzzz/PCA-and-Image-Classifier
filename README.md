# PCA-and-Image-Classifier-
Theory and Application of Principal Components Analysis

I took over 90 photos of a landmark in Buenos Aires over a period of 5 hours and processed all photos down to a size not exceeding 512 pixels in either width or height. Using principal components analysis (PCA), I projected my images down to a 2 dimensional representation and visually inspected the 2D locations of each photo in the new space. Furthermore, I showed the reconstruction from each low-dimensional representation, picked a point that is far away from any known location and plotted its reconstruction. Using the first few PCA components, I trained a linear regression model to predict the time of day the photos were taken. Using the first few PCA components, I also trained the classifier to predict whether the photo was taken in the first half of the photos or in the second half of the photos. I evaluated these models using performance metrics and produced a visualization of their accuracy.
